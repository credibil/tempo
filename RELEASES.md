## 0.11.0

Released 2025-10-17

### Added

### Changed

* Fixed in HTTP SDK where headers were not being forwarded in outbound requests.
* HTTP SDK will now use a key-value store as a cache. This is controlled in a guest by setting a `Cache-Control` header and using `no-cache`, `no-store` and `max-age` directives [as per specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cache-Control). If caching is used the guest must also supply a cache key via a [`If-None-Match` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-None-Match).
* Various other structural changes to the project (see below).
* An initial tidy-up of WIT files (see below). This is temporary, however, and a major refactor is in the works to manage guest and runtime bindings and the model for plugging in infrastructure-specific resources.
